## Meeting Notes

### Money

#### IRB
We got the CAP protocol for filing IRBs.

It's easier to get added to an existing IRB than to get a new one.

Trent will check with Patrick if Jacquana can get added to his IRB.

IRB application is in some ways just a literature review of similar things.

#### Grant
Jacquana found a grant (~20,000) that potentially applies, intersection of physical and mental health, environment, etc.

### Development
